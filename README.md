## Requirements

> **Required**. The project assumes you have a working Anaconda installation.

In order to execute this project, you need at least `40 GB` of available storage space. We do not recommend to run the simulations on a single machine, as this would take about *60 years* to complete. On a HPC cluster, the simulations will take about 2-3 weeks. Training all ratio estimators will take 1-2 days depending on the availability of GPU's. Diagnostics another day.

### Installation of the Anaconda environment

```console
you@localhost:~ $ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
you@localhost:~ $ sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
